Introduction:

In this case study, I am analyzing data from Bellabeat, a smart device company based in San Francisco. I will look at the data to answer key business questions and develop actionable insights.

1. Ask
How can we better market our smart devices based on user trends?
What are some trends in smart device usage?
How could these trends apply to Bellabeat customers?

2. Prepare
This data set does have its limitations. It was collected from 2016-03-12 to 2016-05-12 and had a participant base of 30.

I only looked at two of the tables from this dataset, dailyActivity_merged and sleepDay_Merged.
- In the dailyActivity_merged table I added a new column titled "Activity_Day" so that we have the full date as well of the day of the week when the data was collected.
- In the sleepDay_Merged table there were 3 rows of duplicate information that were taken out before analysis.
