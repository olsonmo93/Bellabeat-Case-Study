I will look at the data to answer key business questions and develop actionable insights.\n\n1. Ask:\nHow can we better market our smart devices based on user trends?\nWhat are some trends in smart device usage?\nHow could these trends apply to Bellabeat customers?\n\n2. Prepare:\nThis data set does have its limitations. It was collected from 2016-03-12 to 2016-05-12 and had a participant base of 30. I only looked at two of the tables from this dataset, dailyActivity_merged and sleepDay_Merged.\n\n3. Process:\nIn the dailyActivity_merged table I added a new column titled \"Activity_Day\" so that we have the full date as well of the day of the week when the data was collected.\nIn the sleepDay_Merged table there were 3 rows of duplicate information that were taken out before analysis.\n\n![Excel_cleaning](https://github.com/olsonmo93/Bellabeat-Case-Study/assets/126408119/c1090a69-2706-452b-b4ce-ec8368cdb2f1)\n\n4. & 5. Analyze and Share\nI uploaded the datasets to BigQuery under the project \"bellabeat-case-study-394315\"\n\n**Insights**\n\n\n  ","metadata":{},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}]}
