Introduction:

In this case study, I am analyzing data from Bellabeat, a smart device company based in San Francisco. I will look at the data to answer key business questions and develop actionable insights.

1. Ask:
How can we better market our smart devices based on user trends?
What are some trends in smart device usage?
How could these trends apply to Bellabeat customers?

2. Prepare:
This data set does have its limitations. It was collected from 2016-03-12 to 2016-05-12 and had a participant base of 30. I only looked at two of the tables from this dataset, dailyActivity_merged and sleepDay_Merged.

3. Process:
In the dailyActivity_merged table I added a new column titled "Activity_Day" so that we have the full date as well of the day of the week when the data was collected.
In the sleepDay_Merged table there were 3 rows of duplicate information that were taken out before analysis.

4. & 5. Analyze and Share
I uploaded the datasets to BigQuery under the project "bellabeat-case-study-394315"

**Insights**
I wanted to see how many times each user wore their tracker

SELECT
  Id, COUNT (Id) AS Total_Id
