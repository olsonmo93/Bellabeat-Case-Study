I looked at the data to answer key business questions and developed actionable insights.\n\n**1. Ask:**\n* How can we better market our smart devices based on user trends?\n* What are some trends in smart device usage?\n* How could these trends apply to Bellabeat customers?\n\n**2. Prepare:**\nThis data set does have its limitations. It was collected from 2016-03-12 to 2016-05-12 and had a participant base of 30. I only looked at two of the tables from this dataset, dailyActivity_merged and sleepDay_Merged.\n\n**3. Process:**\nIn the dailyActivity_merged table I added a new column titled \"Activity_Day\" so that we have the full date as well of the day of the week when the data was collected.\nIn the sleepDay_Merged table there were 3 rows of duplicate information that were taken out before analysis.\n\n![Excel_cleaning](https://github.com/olsonmo93/Bellabeat-Case-Study/assets/126408119/c1090a69-2706-452b-b4ce-ec8368cdb2f1)\n\n**4. & 5.

Act**\n\nTrends found in the data:\n\n* Users spend most of there time in the sedentary category and not a lot of time in light, moderate, and active categories.\n\n* Users slept less than 8hrs a night on average\n\n* Participants were not consistent with tracking their sleep each day, only 24 of participants logged sleep.\n\nRecommendations:\n\n* Bellabeat could offer incentives for users to try and achieve the recommended 10,000 steps per day. This could range from badges that a user earns to points that they could use toward purchasing merchandise, etc.\n\n* Bellabeat could create a feature that reminds users to get moving or be active when the tracker has logged the user has been in the sedentary category for too long.\n\n\n","metadata":{}}]}
