# BigQuery and Tableau

During this case study I started by asking the right questions. I then cleaned the data in Excel and prepared the data, afterward processing it in BigQuery by using queries to pull out relevant information. I took time to analyze the information and then visualize and share the results in Tableau. Finally giving a recommendation to stakeholders based on my findings.
