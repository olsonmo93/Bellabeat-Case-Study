# Bellabeat-Case-Study
## BigQuery and Tableau

During this case study I started by asking the right questions. I then cleaned the data in Excel and prepared the data, afterward processing it in BigQuery by using queries to pull out relevant information. I took time to analyze the information and then visualize and share the results in Tableau. Finally giving a recommendation to stakeholders based on my findings.

This data was collected between 03.12.2016-05.12.2016 and participants wore fitness trackers that collected data regarding their steps, activity level minutes, calories, steps, distance, and more.
